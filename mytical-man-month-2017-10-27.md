## Art vs Science
Writing software is an art more than a science.
* An architecture is an art. The architecture should be simple and easy to understand.
* A component is an art. The component should be easy to work with other component. It should easy to reason of its existence. And it should do one thing and do it well.
* A piece of code is an art. The code should be easy to read, easy to understand, easy to test, and even pleasant to look at.

**Easy**, **pleasant** are very difficult to quantify and human can readily feel. That's why it's an art more than a science.

## Project Planning
* Completing the whole project takes 9 times as the time spent on writing code.
* When you estimate X days to complete the code, make it 2X.

## Design
### Conceptually Integrity
* A system should have a conceptually integrated design. Any components should feel like its a part of the whole system.
* When building a new component, use a solution that is conceptually integrated with other components in the same system. Between two solutions A and B, even if A is **slightly** better but not consistent with the whole system,

### Second System
* The first system is usually simple but has limited features. When designing a second system, many people tend to build a second version of the system with all the features that the first version does not have. This usually makes the system difficult to use and cumbersome.

## Complexity
* There are two kinds of complexity.
 * Essential complexity. A complexity introduced by business requirement.
 * Accidental complexity. A complexity **NOT** introduced by business requirement. e.g. no suitable language or library.
* Accidental complexity can be eliminated. e.g build a shared library, use a high-level language.
* Essential complexity cannot be eliminated.
* When a project is late, think about how to remove essential complexity.

## Passion
* Passion is the key. Software engineers can throughly test their code, their software, but what drives them to become an artist is their passion because being an artist requires passion but being a software engineer does not. It is passion that makes them write beautiful code and design simple architecture.
